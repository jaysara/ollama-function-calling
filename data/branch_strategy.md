## 🔁 **Recommended Branching Strategy: Scaled GitFlow with Team Isolation and CI Gates**

### 🔹 1. **Main Branches**

-   **`main`** (or `master`): Always stable, production-ready.
    
-   **`develop`**: Integration branch for all teams. Only contains code that has passed all tests.
    

### 🔹 2. **Team Feature Branches (Team Isolation)**

Each team works in an isolated long-lived feature branch:

bash

CopyEdit

`feature/team-<team-name>
e.g., feature/team-otr, feature/team-credit-doc` 

This isolates team development and reduces risk of breaking others’ work.

### 🔹 3. **Short-lived Individual Feature Branches**

Within each team’s namespace, devs create branches off their team’s branch:

bash

CopyEdit

`feature/team-credit-doc/feature-user-billing-fix` 

These should be short-lived, merged back into `feature/team-<team-name>` only after:

-   Code reviews
    
-   Unit tests
    
-   Static analysis
    

### 🔹 4. **Pull Request (PR) Process & Gates**

Implement a gated merge strategy:

-   **From individual feature → team branch**: Require 1-2 reviewers, unit test pass
    
-   **From team branch → develop**: Require:
    
    -   ✅ All tests (unit, integration, E2E) passed
        
    -   ✅ Code reviewed by other teams (rotating leads)
        
    -   ✅ Optional: Conflict resolution review
        

This minimizes risk when merging team work to the integration branch.

----------

## 🧪 5. **Automated Testing Tiers**

-   **Team-level CI**: Run unit and integration tests for team components on each team branch.
    
-   **Develop-level CI**: Run full suite (unit + integration + contract tests) on every PR to `develop`.
    
-   **Nightly E2E on `develop`** to catch issues early.
    

----------

## 🔀 6. **Release Branches**

Create a dedicated branch for each release from `develop`, e.g.:

arduino

CopyEdit

`release/1.0.0` 

Stabilize here with only bug fixes or QA feedback. Once ready, merge into `main` and tag.

----------

## 📦 7. **Repository Strategy**

-   Prefer **one repo per bounded context or service** if separation is clear (microservices).
    
-   If shared libraries or APIs are reused, split those into separate, versioned libraries.

### 🛠 How Teams Should Handle **Defect Fixes**

There are **three types of defect fixes**, handled differently depending on urgency:

#### 1. **During Development (pre-release)**

-   Fix directly in the relevant team branch (e.g., `feature/team-intraday`)
    
-   Merge back to `develop` after verification.
    

#### 2. **During Release Stabilization**

-   Fixes go into the `release/x.y` branch.
    
-   Cherry-pick back to `develop` and relevant team branch if needed.
    

#### 3. **Post-Production (Hotfix)**

-   Create a branch from `main`:
    
    `hotfix/fix-defect-1` 
    
-   Apply the fix.
    
-   Merge back into:
    
    -   `main` (for immediate prod patch)
        
    -   `develop` (to keep it consistent)
        
    -   `team-` branch (if needed)

#### 🔶 `release/1.0.0`

-   Created from `develop` when code freeze starts for release
    
-   Bug fixes are committed here while QA tests the release
    

#### 🔧 `fix/null-pointer-qa`

-   Branch created off `release/1.0.0` to fix a QA-identified bug
    
-   Merged back into:
    
    -   `release/1.0.0` (so the fix is part of the release)
        
    -   `develop` (to avoid regression in next version)
        
    -   Team branch if necessary
        

#### 🔥 `hotfix/prod-1`, `hotfix/prod-2`

-   Created directly from `main` to patch urgent production issues
    
-   Once fixed:
    
    -   Merge back into `main` (for immediate deployment)
        
    -   Merge into `develop` (so future versions include the fix)
        
    -   Optional: Merge into `release` or team branches
